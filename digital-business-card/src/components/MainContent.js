                I am a quality engineer who develops testing frameworks and automation suites.
                I'm currently trying to upskill, which is why I'm learning React.
                Hopefully, some day, I will be a frontend developer!

            <p className="main--para">
                I love sport, football & boxing (I'm a big Man United fan!). I also love exercising and enjoy to box.
                Playing guitar is one of my favourite things to do to relax.
                Despite no longer officially studying it, I also still enjoy maths and physics.
