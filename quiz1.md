1. Why do we need to `import React from "react"` in our files?
Defines JSX

2. If I were to console.log(page) in index.js, what would show up?
A JS object

3. What's wrong with this code:
```
const page = (
    <h1>Hello</h1>
    <p>This is my website!</p>
)
```
Should be nested in a parent element


4. What does it mean for something to be "declarative" instead of "imperative"?
Declaritive - what to do (system handles the details)
Imperative - what to do and how to do it

5. What does it mean for something to be "composable"?
Small components can be brought together to make a full piece of work
